# Installation

So, this is how I do it:

1. Put the repo somewhere
1.2. Get virtualenv (```easy_install virtualenv```) if you do not have it yet (as long as you want to test this locally. Otherwise, go to step 2)
1.3. Create a new virtualenv inside the downloaded folder with ```virtualenv venv```, open it with ```. venv/bin/activate```
2. Install flask with ```pip install flask```
3. Start the testserver with ```python danielvsmax.py```
4. Go to 127.0.0.1:5000
5. Enjoy. This should work. You'll work it out.

If you want to install this on your host/webserver, follow the instructions your host/your mom provides you with. It's just another Flask-site. And check the [Flask Documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/).
